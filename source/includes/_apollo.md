# Apollo UI

<aside class="success"> Apollo is an online invoicing app that comes free with Space Invoices.</aside>

__Apollo ([getapollo.io](https://getapollo.io)) allows users to view data created through the API in a user friendly visual interface.__

Each account created through the API can use their credentials to login to Apollo and view all their assigned/authorised organizations.

We are planning to also provide Apollo as a whitelabel edition so parts of it can be added to apps as drop-in elements without the current branding.
